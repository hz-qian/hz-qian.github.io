Hi, Welcome to my website! I am an MPhil student in the  [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/)  at the  [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) . I received my Bachelor’s degree in  [Sociology](https://www.soc.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  from  [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  in June 2023.
My research interests include social stratification and mobility, marriage and family,and quantitative methods. Currently, I particularly interested in:
* How has the strict one-child policy shaped Chinese people’s gender perceptions and parenting styles?
* As the Chinese government begins to abandon birth control strategies and encourage higher birth rates, what sacrifices will individuals have to make during this reversal? How do the impacts vary among people of different socioeconomic statuses?

Feel free to reach me at [haozhi.qian@connect.ust.hk](mailto:haozhi.qian@connect.ust.hk) with any questions regarding my research!

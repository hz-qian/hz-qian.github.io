Hi, Welcome to my website! I am an MPhil student in the  [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/)  at the  [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) . I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in  [Sociology](https://www.soc.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  from  [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/)  in June 2023.
My research interests include social stratification and mobility, marriage and family,and quantitative methods. Currently, I particularly interested in the relationship between the changing marriage pattern and the social transformation.
Feel free to reach me at [haozhi.qian@connect.ust.hk](mailto:haozhi.qian@connect.ust.hk) with any questions regarding my research!
